# UFC-Elo-Monitor
EloTracker is a personal project designed to track and analyze UFC fighter rankings using an Elo rating system. It adjusts Elo based on fight outcomes, with higher gains for early-round finishes and degradation for inactivity. The project also maintains a time-series of Elo changes.
